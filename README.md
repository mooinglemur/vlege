About
-----

Vlege is a **Very Low-Effort Gallery Engine**, powering HTML image galleries based upon a native filesystem structure. Complicated server-side scripting languages and databases are eschewed in favor of basic HTML and JavaScript generated using a simple Python script and some helpful libraries.


Usage
-----

First make sure you have Python3 and the necessary libraries installed, using your system's package system or via `pip`. You will need *Jinja2* and *Pillow*(with JPEG support). Install Vlege by downloading the script and placing it in your `$PATH` somewhere.

```
$ mkdir ~/bin
$ PATH=$PATH:~/bin
$ git clone https://madeitwor.se/vlege.git
$ ln -s vlege/vlege/vlege.py ~/bin/vlege
$
```

Now run Vlege by pointing it at your album.

```
$ vlege /path/to/your/album/
$
```

If everything went well, you should get a pile of -thumb images, and an index.html listing. If everything didn't go well, you'll get an error message and possibly a stacktrace.
